<div class="division"><h2>5.AUDI A8</h2></div>
<p>The fourth-generation Audi A8 you see here is the only production ready vehicle globally that gets Level 3 of autonomous driving. No, it won’t drive you to work and back while you enjoy a massage in the rear seat, but it has sharpened its ‘controlled self-drive’ skills that require the driver to take charge beyond a point. With its evolved ‘Traffic Jam Pilot’, the A8 can now assume complete responsibility of steering, throttle and brakes, and keep moving in bumper-to-bumper traffic at up to speeds of 60kph on clearly-marked single carriageways. Let’s strike out Indian roads, then. But if you want to change lanes, or go faster, you will have to override the computer. Why is it not fully autonomous, you ask? Because the world isn’t ready for cars that don’t need human intervention after a point – and certainly not India. </p>
<p>When engineers urge you to drive into a wall at parking speeds and not hit the brakes, it shows the kind of faith they have in the technology they’ve developed. Yes, I drove into a wall and reversed into barricades at 10kph, and if you’re wondering how the demolition derby went; the A8 steered away from the side walls and braked hard on its own just in time to keep its all LED jewellery intact. Impressive. Even more notable were the A8’s self parking skills. Parallel and perpendicular parking are party tricks even the Benzes, BMWs and Volvos possess. But we remotely parked the A8 into a slot using a smartphone, switched off the engine, rolled its windows up and locked the doors – all without even getting close to the car. If walls and barricades weren’t enough, Audi made one of its interns ride a bicycle dangerously close to our A8 as we tried getting out of it in a parking lot. Twice. The cyclist survived, on both occasions. First, the Audi deliberately delayed opening the doors letting the cyclist pass safely and then, it braked on its own as we tried sneaking out of a tight lane, sensing oncoming traffic.</p>

<div class="division"><h2>4. BENTLEY CONTINENTAL GT</h2></div>
<p>There’s a key point in Bentley’s timeline that we can call BC: Before Continental. So vital was the first Conti GT – not only for sales, but setting a template and tone for the whole brand – that you could easily argue that were it not for the two-door coupe Bentley might very well not be with us today. 66,000 have been sold in the last 13 years. That’s a huge number. The most successful luxury car of modern times? Probably.</p>
<p>And now there’s a new one. It must sell well, and it must still be the focal point for the whole brand, to embody what a Bentley is so we don’t assume it’s an SUV with a body image problem. It’s a handsome thing, the new Conti GT, at least in profile, where the front wheels have been shifted forward 135mm to improve the weight distribution and drop the engine lower and further back in the chassis.</p>
<p><b>Bentley has given customers what they demanded: a more athletic, sporting, rapid, capable Continental GT. I’m happy for them. In the areas owners obviously care most about – performance and handling, it’s night-and-day better than the old one. The 48v electrics, longer wheelbase and air suspension have brought crispness to the dynamics and allowed the car to cope admirably with the huge increase in straight-line performance.</b>

<div class="division"><h2>3. ROLLS ROYCE PHANTOM</h2></div>
<p>Fourteen years is an eternity in the world of luxury and entertainment, the Phantom’s principal provinces. So, climbing behind the wheel ( and it is a bit of a climb ) of an all new Rolls is a special moment. The dash has been reconfigured as an art gallery, the structure itself has the implacability of Mount Rushmore, and of course, there’s the Spirit of Ecstasy, pointing forward from the longest bonnet out there. More than ever, taking the helm is not like driving other cars.

It’s also a bit like driving a beautiful building, and it takes time to feel totally confident behind the wheel. Many owners - patrons, as Rolls airily describes them - like to drive themselves, so there’s a renewed emphasis on attributes you might not associate with a car as imperious as this. Feedback, for example. In addition, to the fabled magic carpet ride, there’s now more dialogue.

The wheel is a tad thicker than before, and fully electric power steering arrives, but the mode of operation remains the same: slide the delicate little column stalk into D, apply the merest suggestion of pressure to the throttle pedal, and ease away in such a manner as not to rustle the copy of Pork Belly Futures Digest that’s being mulled over in the rear.

The Phantom still prefers to waft rather than hustle, although it can do so very ably should the need arise. Even with a ( heavily revised ) version of Rolls’s 6.6-litre twin-turbo V12 - it’s 6.75 litres in capacity here, and makes 536bhp- it feels inappropriate to trouble the power reserve gauge any more than necessary.</p>
<p> <b>Nothing in life is perfect but the Phantom gets close. An impeccably engineered automotive experience.</b></p>

<div class="division"><h2>2. RANGE ROVER</h2></div>
<p>Look, the updates to the 2018 Range Rover aren’t too significant. I mean, unless you’re the type that goes to every new car launch with a microscope, you’d probably miss what is new to this car. On the outside, at least. The tweaks are a little more conspicuous on the inside. What Land Rover has essentially done is update the Range Rover to deal with its ever-evolving competition — not the full-size German SUVs, but their luxury sedans. The Range Rover is priced at a point where it cannot really compete with a Mercedes-Benz GLS, it’s more of an alternative to the luxury and exclusiveness the S-Class offers. In fact, if you really, go all out with its spec, it could cost you as much as a Bentayga.</p>
<p>The variant we are driving is the Vogue SE, which costs Rs 2.05 crore in its base form. For that money, you get something with the floor space that rivals a small flat in Mumbai with plenty of luxury, performance and the exclusivity to match it. The Range Rover was hard to fault in its pre-facelift avatar and any criticism of a bland dash can no longer be levelled at it. It sits, without question, alongside the best luxury cars money can buy. A proper, proper flagship from Land Rover. </p>
<P><b>A proper luxury SUV that rivals the best in automotive opulence. </b></P>

<div class="division"><h2>1. MERCEDES BENZ S-CLASS</h2></div>
<p>Ever since the new E-Class was introduced to us earlier this year, there have been several questions about the importance of the S-Class. Yes, the long-wheelbase version of the E350d that comes with the three-pointed star does do plenty, and it does pretty well too. However, it isn’t by accident that it has always been the S-Class and not one of the smaller pretenders that lays claim to the title of ‘best car in the world’. And, as luck has it, just as we were questioning its relevance, Mercedes has gone ahead and given us a taste of a properly upgraded version of the S-Class and the list of changes is a pretty lengthy one. Six-thousand five hundred parts long to be precise. And it isn’t just skin deep, there is a whole lot that has changed on the inside and under the hood too.
 </p>
<p> This new car probably has too many things to take your mind off the driving. It is quite a challenge to let the car take over and trust it to do everything properly (you still do need to watch for pedestrians walking across the road), but once you begin to trust the systems, it feels incredibly easy. There is more that you can do and tend to pay less attention to the road. The scenery and in some cases, the cellphone, may become too much of a distraction and I am not quite sure how good that will be, especially given that the steering assist is happy to function even if you have just one hand on the steering wheel.</p>
<P><B>Loads of autonomous driving aids and new engines make this a proper upgrade</B></P>
